```bash
export STABILITY_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
node server.js
```
3. Toggle to Live mode using the switch in the top-left corner

### Environment Variables
- `STABILITY_API_KEY`: Your Stability AI API key for live outfill generation
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 52778)

## üß† How the AI System Works

### Outfill Algorithm
1. **Block Detection**: Image divided into 4x4 grid of blocks
2. **Visibility Tracking**: System tracks which blocks are visible in viewport
3. **Priority Queue**: Blocks prioritized by:
   - Visibility percentage (0-100 points)
   - Distance from viewport center (0-20 points)
   - Fully visible bonus (+50 points)
4. **Generation**: Up to 2 blocks generate simultaneously
5. **Dynamic Resorting**: Queue resorts on every pan/zoom for optimal experience

### API Integration (Live Mode)
- **Endpoint**: Stability AI v2beta outpaint API
- **Mask Generation**: Creates precise masks for each block area
- **Prompt**: "psychedelic floral pattern, vibrant colors, organic shapes, detailed botanical elements"
- **Creativity**: 0.35 (balanced between coherence and creativity)
- **Error Handling**: Failed generations show red error indicators

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - No frameworks or dependencies
- **Backend**: Node.js server for environment variable handling
